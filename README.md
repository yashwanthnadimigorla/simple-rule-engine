Key Attributes: It highlights the main attributes used in the rule evaluation (age, department, income, and spend), giving users an immediate understanding of the project's focus.
3. Features
Dynamic Creation and Evaluation of Rules: This indicates that users can create and evaluate rules in real-time, enhancing the flexibility of the application.
Combines Multiple Rules: This feature emphasizes that the application can take various rules and evaluate them together, which is crucial for complex decision-making processes.
Extensible Architecture: This suggests that the codebase is designed in a way that allows for future enhancements or additional features to be added easily.
4. Installation
This section provides instructions for setting up the project.

a. Dependencies
Python 3.x: Specifies that Python version 3 or higher is required to run the application.
SQLite: Indicates that SQLite, a lightweight database, is used, which is typically included with Python installations.
unittest library: Mentioning that this library is included with Python indicates that users do not need to install it separately for running tests.
